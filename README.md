# HTML-and-CSS

What is HTML

HTML (Hypertext Makeup Language)
HTML is a language used to make web pages. It helps developers organize content like titles, paragraphs, and links. It uses tags enclosed in angle brackets to define different parts of a page. Opening tags start an element, and closing tags end it (<p>, </p>).

CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is the design tool for web pages, determining colors, fonts, sizes, and animations. Even with mistakes, browsers try to make the page look good, making CSS like a resilient problem-solver for creating attractive web pages.

JavaScript

JavaScript is a special programming language that adds cool, interactive features to websites. It's like a superhero because it can do things HTML and CSS can't. But it's sensitiveâ€”if there's a problem, it might not work. Websites need to work on old computers and browsers, so they use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together. Each does something different, and together they make websites strong and cool.

HTML Syntax 

HTML is a language for organizing web pages using tags enclosed in < and > symbols. Tags come in pairs: opening and closing. Elements, like paragraphs, are defined with these tags, giving meaning to content. Elements can be nested within each other, creating a tree-like structure. The browser uses this structure to understand and display content. Proper nesting and closing tags are crucial for conveying meaning accurately.

HTML Paragraphs

To make text appear as separate paragraphs on a webpage, we use HTML tags called <p> and </p>. These tags indicate the beginning and end of each paragraph. Without these tags, the browser treats multiple lines of text as a single paragraph. By adding <p> before the first paragraph and </p> after each paragraph, the browser understands that they are distinct paragraphs.

HTML headlines

HTML Headlines help organize web content into sections. There are six levels of headlines, from h1 to h6, with h1 being the biggest. Each level has a different look and shows the importance of the content. It's important to choose the right headline level based on its meaning, not just how it looks. For example, h1 is usually for the main title, and h2 can be for a subtitle. Keeping headlines consistent helps people using screen readers understand the page better. While there aren't strict rules, using these headline levels well makes content easier to understand and improves the user experience.
